                                          A scientific, non-public opinion poll is a type of survey or investigation designed to measure public opinion about a particular topic or series of subjects. The trained interviewer asks the questions of the people chosen at random from the population being measured. Along with this, public opinion polls now play a vital role in politics. They are used during the course of election campaigns by clients and by the media to see which candidates are ahead and who is likely to emerge victoriously.

                                            Political polls is a type of opinion poll. When corrected, the poll is an accurate social science in which there are strict rules about sample size, random selection of participants and margins of error. However, even the best opinion poll is only a snapshot of public opinion in the special moments of time, not an eternal reality. If you conduct a poll on nuclear energy right after the nuclear disaster, then it is going to be much less than the day before the disaster. This is also true for political elections.
