                                           Call centers play an important role in campaigning because the political party and leader are not able to reach the public in time. Because of this, they seek help from the call center and they are able to register their presence among the public. Call centers appeal to politicians to vote through call records. Along with this, the notification of public meetings, rallies, and other programs in elections is easily accessible to all the people of their area.
