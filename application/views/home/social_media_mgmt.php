                                             Social media can be used differently for campaigning. If a political party or politician wants to start his campaign on social media, they can also get help from a company. Or you can start your campaign by making an account on social media itself. For this, the politician will have to update the program information, rally, public meeting and public relations information on social media daily and connect with more people.
